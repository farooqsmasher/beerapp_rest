# Persistence
By default, the project uses [the MYSQL in-memory DB](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) and - `persistence-h2.properties`.

If you want to configure  - for example - MySQL - you'll need to specify a different property on startup:
```
persistenceTarget=Mysql
```
And of course, if you are going to use MySQL, you'llneed to run a MySQL instance locally and you'll need to either change the default credentials here, or create the following user/password in your local installation
```
location :beerapp_rest\src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\spring-config.xml
```
```
Import sql file
Location:
```
